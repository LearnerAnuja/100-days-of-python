Day 2 of 100days of python is all about understanding data types and how to manipulate strings in Python. This is a crucial topic in programming because data types help us to store and organize data in our code. Understanding how to manipulate strings is also important because strings are used to represent text in programming.

To start with, we need to understand what data types are. In Python, there are several data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, and lists. Each data type has its own unique properties and ways to manipulate them. For example, integers are whole numbers, while floats are decimal numbers. Booleans are true or false values, while lists are collections of data.

After learning about data types, we dove into string manipulation. Strings are sequences of characters, and we can manipulate them using different methods. We learned how to concatenate strings, convert strings to uppercase or lowercase, and remove whitespace from strings.

Finally, we put our knowledge into practice by creating a tip calculator program. We used input() function to ask the user for the bill amount, tip percentage, and number of people splitting the bill. Then, we used string manipulation techniques to format the output and display the calculated tip amount per person.
Overall, Day 2 was a great introduction to data types and string manipulation in Python, and creating the tip calculator was a fun way to practice what we learned. I'm excited to continue learning more in the 100days of python challenge!
