<h1>Day2- Tip Calculator</h1>
<p>On Day 2 of 100 Days of Python, we dove deeper into understanding data types and learned how to manipulate strings. We also created a tip calculator project, which allowed us to apply the concepts we learned in a practical way. With the use of variables, operators, and string manipulation, we were able to create a program that calculates the total bill amount including the desired tip percentage. Overall, it was a great day of learning and applying new skills! #100DaysOfPython #TipCalculator ðŸ’»ðŸ”¢ðŸ’°
