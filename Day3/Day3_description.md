In this project, I learned about control flow and logical operators in Python, and used them to create a fun text-based game called Treasure Island. 🏝️🗺️ The game uses if/else statements and logical operators to guide the player through various scenarios and decisions as they search for treasure on a deserted island. Through this project, I gained a better understanding of how to use control flow and logical operators in Python to make decisions and create interactive programs. Excited to keep learning! 🤩 #100daysofpython #pythonprogramming #beginner
