<p>Welcome to my repository for the #100DaysOfPython challenge!</p>
<h2> Introduction</h2>
<p>The #100DaysOfPython challenge is a commitment to code for at least an hour every day for 100 days. This challenge is designed to help me improve my skills in Python programming and build a habit of consistent coding practice.</p>
<h2>Repository Content</h2>
<p>In this repository, you'll find my daily progress, code snippets, and project files for the 100 days of the challenge. I'll be sharing my journey, the concepts I'm learning, and the projects I'm building.</p>
<h2>Repository Structure</h2>
<p>The repository is organized into 100 folders (one for each day of the challenge), with each folder containing a README file, code snippets, and project files for that day's progress.</p>
<h2>Day-by-Day Progress</h2>
<p>To keep track of my progress, I'll be updating the  <a href="https://github.com/LearnerAnuja/100-days-of-python/blob/main/progress_log.md">progress_log </a> file every day. This file will contain a brief summary of the work I've done, the concepts I've learned, and the challenges I've faced.I will also be posting updates on my <a href="https://twitter.com/home">Twitter</a> and<a href="https://medium.com/@LearnerAnuja" >Medium </a>accounts.</p>
<h2>Connect with Me</h2>
<p>I'm excited to connect with other developers and learners who are also taking up the #100DaysOfPython challenge. Feel free to connect with me on GitHub and let's code together!</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
